# StarCraft-code
Written using BWAPI

A simple code that reads a plan and executes it in StarCraft using BWAPI
Get the latest BWAPI: https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/releases/tag/v4.2.0

A sample plan (named as Plan.txt) is as follows:

Gather Minerals
Build Refinery 1
Train SCV 1
Gather Gas
End

The sample plan is provided along with the code and must be copied to the StarCraft game directory where the game files are stored
On launching StarCraft via Chaoslauncher, each line of the plan is read and executed

Disclaimer: This is just a simple test code based on ExampleAIModule provided along with the BWAPI installation. 
            May encounter some issues/bugs when running it
