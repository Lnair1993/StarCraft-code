# StarCraft Plan Reader

A simple code that reads a plan and executes it in StarCraft using BWAPI (https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/releases/tag/v4.2.0)

A sample plan (named as "Plan.txt") is provided along with the code and must be copied to the StarCraft game directory where the game files are stored

On launching StarCraft via Chaoslauncher, each line of the plan is read and executed

Disclaimer: This is just a simple test code I wrote to familiarize myself with BWAPI. It is based on the ExampleAIModule provided along with the BWAPI installation. 
May encounter some issues/bugs when running it
